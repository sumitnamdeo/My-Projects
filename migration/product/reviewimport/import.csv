,"<strong>Very quickly provided relief from an acute cellulitis on my leg and foot. </strong>
I ordered EmuaidMAX after enduring five days of intense pain from a case of bacterial cellulitis. The product arrived the next day. I immediately applied the product and started feeling relief from the pain, which I can only describe as a really bad sunburn. I continued the antibiotics prescribed by my doctor and have kept my leg elevated. Each subsequent application of the product has seemed to really help accelerate the healing. I have been using it for three days and can see a big difference in the color (much less red) and the pain, diminished but not gone. The swelling has also reduced and I am much more comfortable. I wish I had the product on hand when first symptoms appeared, I think it would have reduced the severity significantly. I am going to tell my doctor about this when I see him again. I should note that I am usually skeptical about 'miracle' treatments. I will say that this product does seem to work as advertised. It provides quick releaf and is something I plan on having on hand for the future.",Jeffrey,,16,1,5,1,09-02-2013 16:03
,"<strong>Great product </strong> I have had a venuos leg ulcer for well over a year. Nothing i found helped at all. I spent allot of money on all kinds of products, and none of them worked at all. I started using emuaid, and within a week, most of the pain went away, but even better, the ulcer started to heal. Anyone who has a leg ulcer knows how bad, and how hard they are to heal. I urge anyone with this horrid infliction to buy this product. Use compression, and emuaid max. Your ulcer will heal.Three weeks ago, mine was 2 x 3  now it is almost gone.",David,,16,1,5,1,16-01-2013 16:04

,"<strong>Fast service, fast results, just delighted!</strong> 
I could see a visible change for the better in my ankle within one hour of applying this product. It is a generous size, too, which makes the price more palatable.

I was unable to get my cellulitis to go away for MONTHS, but now it is on the way out in a very dramatic way. I had tried tea-tree oil, silver solution, grapefruit-seed extract, castor oil, bentonite clay, various homeopathics, cocoanut oil, even ghee! What a relief to find something that works and is easy and pleasant to use!",Sheila,,16,1,5,1,14-12-2012 16:05
,"This is the second time I have ordered. Original Emuaid worked well but just wasn't strong enough for my persistant cellulitis. This time I ordered the double strength. Could see the difference overnight. Have been using it on other first-aid issues too.

,"At the beginning of the year, my daughter contracted Molluscum contagiosum.  I was told that there was nothing we could do for the condition &amp; it would go away in a couple of YEARS! :(  I googled home remedies, came across this website &amp; ordered immediately.  After just 2-3 WEEKS of using the Emuaid MAX, the molluscum had completely disappeared!  My daughter also has frequent bouts of eczema &amp; the Emuaid MAX clears that right up as well!  I found benefits for myself as well.  A few months ago I started to get acne on my arms (which I never had before) due to some hormones I was put on.  Since the Emuaid MAX cleared up my daughter's molluscum so quickly, I decided to try it on my acne.  It went away within DAYS of using the cream!  Now, every time I can feel a pimple starting to form on my face (which doesn't happen often), I dab a little on the spot &amp; the pimple disappears overnight.  This stuff is a miracle!!",aks07,,16,1,5,1,22-08-2013 17:53

,"The site works well. The products also work very well. Emuaid Homeopathic medicine (Small white jar with red lettering-Maximum strength)is the most curative medicine I have ever used. It works great on any skin condition. I also take the Emuaid First Defense Max capsules. I do not know if these pills help, or work at all, but I believe that maybe they are a good thing to use. I hope so anyways.

,"My only regret is that I did not take a before and after picture.  I am completely amazed!  I BEG you parents to try this if your child has Molluscum!!  Last July my son contracted Molluscum contagiosum at camp.  It was under his arm and down his side.  It quickly spread and became infected more than once.  We had to put him on anitbiotics and steroid cream.  Nothing would make it go away though.  He was miserable.  He would sometimes lay in bed crying, in agony from it.  It hurt.  It burned.  It itched.  The doctor said it would take 1-2 years to go away.  He told us we could try taking Tagamet.  It helped in some kids, but it would take 2-3 months to even begin to make a difference, and even then it might not.  My son's case was so severe.  We made an appointment with a dermatologist but it would take 5 months to get in to see her.  He was so upset.  He was so desperate to get rid of this condition, he even said he would let the dermatologist burn, cut, freeze them off if that was the only way to get rid of them.  Understand the child had about 60+ of these.  I did all kinds of research online about the virus he'd contracted, and there really did seem to be no cure!  While waiting to get in with a dermatologist we faithfully gave him the Tagamet twice a day for months.  He didn't do a lot but it was all we had.  I was filling a prescription for more Tagamet about 3 weeks ago, when the Pharmacist found out what my child was taking it for, and she got SO excited.  Her child had had Molluscum too, and so did a niece.  She told me about Emuaid Max.  She said it was a miracle drug!   I looked it up online.  We had enough time to order it and try it for 7-8 days before the derm appointment.  WOW!!!!!  The Molluscum was 70% gone by the time we saw her.  Two nights ago he was down to 17.  Tonight, there are 7 places left and they are CLOSE to being gone.  PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!!!  I told both my pediatrician and the dermatologist.  This product is AMAZING!  We literally thank GOD for it!  Another couple of days and this condition that TORTURED my child since the 1st of July will be GONE.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!!",JohnsMom,,16,1,5,1,28-01-2014 21:48
,"I had boils in my armpits two years ago, I went to the doctor and they thought that I had Lynphomic cancer,  They cut out five boils and bi-opcied them, they came out clear of cancer, but the healing process was horible.  I got boils again last year and didn't want to go through that ordeal again , so I found Emerald on the internet-read the reveiws and ordered the Max strength.  As soon as I applied it I found that the boils began to shrink, but the best thing was the pain went away.  I intially had 11 boils and one by one they shrunk and went away, some did form heads and discharge though which was better for faster healing.  I never thought when I bought this stuff that it would completely cure the problem.  It took about 45 days to get rid of all the boils, but it was painless--nothing like the holes the doctor left in me.
I have poor circulation in my legs and the swelling and redness hurts some times.  I tried Emerald Max and the swelling and  redness decreased almost over night.   I also had an infection on my ankle which started as a nerve ending iritation, it turned into a boil and came to a head, once that happened the emerald max took control of the wound and has almost cleared up the problem, in the beginning the pain was unbearable, but now there is no pain and the swelling is gone.

I would give your product a five star rating  it did everything you said it would do and more.  I have recommended it to other people who have cronic leg ulcers and redness from fluid pooling in there legs--They are amazed because the doctor gives them stuff to use and nothing happens, but emerald max helps in one application.

Thank you for this great product.

,"I freaked out when I found out my daughter had Molluscum because some people said that their child had it for 3-4 years. I have 3 kids and couldn't imagine this sticking around that long and passing from kid to kid. The EmuaidMax was everything I dreamed it would be. While I was waiting for it to come in the mail, I treated the Molluscum with Tea Tree Oil twice per day. It seemed to dry them out and they looked like they were going away slowly. Once the Emuaid arrived, I continued to use the tea tree oil as well as the Emuaid. The combination of these two treatments knocked it out in under a month. It is so important to be consistent with it. To keep it from spreading to my other kids or kids at school, I put her in pants everyday (hers was on her lower half). I also wore gloves to apply the treatment and washed her clothes, bath towels and sheets often.  I Love Emuaid!",SAlexis,,16,1,5,1,15-03-2014 14:38
,"I bought 2 jars of Emuaid Max in a desperate attempt to help my Mom's cellulitis, which tested positive for MRSA. It had spread to almost totally cover both legs from foot to thigh.  I tried the Emuaid, along with other silver products, which healed the oozing sores but not the redness. I was so disappointed because I had high hopes based on the reviews, and the stuff is expensive. Then her nurse said it looked like dermatitis and I remembered she's always been allergic to metal, which apparently includes silver. I looked at the ingredients in Emuaid and saw the silver and considered returning the product.  But my grandson had just gotten over ringworm he got from wrestling, so I decided to hold onto it just in case someone else in the house needed it. Then, since I'm Mom's care giver 24/7, I contracted MRSA too. I treated the boil with silver and tea tree oil and manuka honey, but the bandage adhesive irritated my skin and then a rash developed, looking very similar to Mom's cellulitis. I remembered the Emuaid and started applying it a few days ago, twice a day.  The redness diminished overnight, and continues to diminish every day. Another small rash started on my wrist, and after just a day, I'm seeing significant improvement.  So I'm here to order another jar. It's definitely worth the price.",CP,,16,1,5,1,20-03-2014 09:42
,"Love, love, love the Emuaid product line! My husband used EmuaidMAX on shingles with great satisfaction; my teenage son uses the Overnight Acne Treatment with literal"" overnight success (we still giggle about how amazing it is EVERY time!); we use EmuaidMAX on any and all types of skin bumps or blemishes; teenage son also uses EmuaidMAX and Overnight Acne Treatment on sports helmet chin guard rash which works amazingly well.

,I don't believe I have ever been so anxious to receive a product.  I am almost driven mad / suicidal by an extremely intense itch on my chest.  It comes and goes and I have tried numerous OTC products but shy away from the harsh chemicals.  I read the reviews for the Emuaid Max and ordered it on 3-26-2014.  Blazing fast shipment - received within 3 days!!! Used it at once and gained immediate relief - finally.  Email confirmation and notification of shipment were right on.  NOTE:  I also placed an order the same day for the First Defense as it appears going forward  that may alleviate the itching issues.  I will provide a review in about one month.  Thank you so much for your perfect product and service!  I will be ordering MORE and look forward to doing business with you. Blessings!,bjmcphail1@comcast.net,9057,16,1,5,1,29-03-2014 16:08

,"Dear Emuaid, Love your product. There are five people in my house including my grandson that is 2 years old. Are thankful for this amazing product. We became effected with micro bites and it was horrible. Cleaning and washing clothes was a night mare . 
Couldn't sleep of all the bites and itching. We try soaps it was working but our skin was getting very dry .  So dry that we had it all over again. My son started searching online and found EMUAID!! He read the reviews and the natural ingredients which I like dealing with than chemicals. Cause we already had severe skin damage. We started Emuaidmax and Emuaid soap and quickly in 24 hours we all felt a huge difference. The redness went away and the skin was healing in the 3rd day. When I feel a bite I apply it and its gone in minutes. Wow, love it. Even my 2 years old grandson said it was powerful stuff. He was a happy camper after Emuaid. We, house hold of 5, Thanks you.  I'm ordering more cause it also healed eczema for my husband, son and grandson. Again THANK YOU","nilda-June 3, 2014",,16,1,5,1,03-06-2014 01:35

,"Sunday a week ago I was taken to the ER. I was very sick with a Fever, Rash and Severe Pain. I was told I had The Shingles. The Shingles rash started in the center of my back, then wrapped around a nerve line on my left side under my arm and under my right breast. I researched Shingles and found your Website. Thank God! What a blessing to have found your Website. I immediately ordered the EmuaidMax ointment. I kept the Rash site clean with just running water from the shower. I did not scratch or rub the rash. I also kept my hands sanitized. I wore white cotton T-Shirts to prevent any fabric from irritating the skin. After only 1 week. the terrible Shingles Rash is beginning to scab and heal. Many of the blisters have disappeared completely. I still have pain and some scabbing. We apply the EmuaidMax to the Shingles Rash several times daily. With time we believe most if not ALL of the Rash will disappear completely. I highly reco mmend EmuaidMax for The Shingles and I am very grateful to have found your product. It is extraordinary! EmuaidMax has soothed and even relieved a lot of the severe pain associated with The Shingles Rash. Thank you EmuaidMax!!!",Tamara S,,16,1,5,1,09-07-2014 12:23
,"This is my second order and I was more than amazed by the results. I recently got very sunburned, I was actually wondering if I should go to the ER, I remembered I had your Emuaid that I ordered and applied it to my burnt legs, immediately the pain went away and my legs felt normal, I could actually walk without pain. My legs are still very red I am sure it will take time to heal. 

My daughter got stung by a bee a day later and I applied the ointment and again the pain went away and the next day the bit was almost gone. I am very amazed at the results and especially since I prefer to use only natural ingrediants when possible.

Not only that, but having the spots frozen off was extremely painful to my son.  I really wanted to take a more homeopathic approach to getting my son relief and getting rid of the Molluscum.  When I found Emuaid Max I was a little hesitant but really sold on the 30 day guarantee and positive reviews.  My son was also born with congenital heart disease so I am very concerned with keeping him healthy.  It took about two months for the spots to disappear and that I because I was not very consistent at times.  He had them on his belly, thighs, and arms.

I have tried everything my dermatologist has recommended, with little to no relief. I would get flare ups every week, and be in constant pain and drainage and I am only 26 . I hated it. I had seen this online while looking for things to manage HS, and just never tried it because I was worried it would not work. I finally broke down and purchased the emuaid max, because I do have HS severely and thought it would stand a better chance of working. I use it religiously morning and evening, just a little all over my affected areas. I cannot believe how well this works.

,I bought this when my daughter contracted molluscum contagiosum.  I was pretty devastated.  She was four at the time and had it fairly bad - all down the side of her body.  I was terrified she would get it on her face and that kids would be mean.  I spent hours on the computer scaring myself more (they didn't really bother her that much).  We became diligent in hand washing and I wanted so badly to get rid of it as fast as I could for her.  I purchased several remedies promising a miracle cure.  This was the only product that seemed to help at all.  It did absolutely nothing for the spots that were more advanced however you can tell when new spots are beginning to show up and it did seem to keep them at bay without getting much worse and it I caught it right away and put this on there it did seem to work.  i am glad this worked so well for other people  but my experience was that it only worked on places where they were beginning to show up but that did certainly help as she did get a few spots that tried to come up on her face and this did seem to make those go away.  In the end  the others went away better if I just left them alone which is what her peditritian told me to do in the first place.  It took about 10 months to go away.  I know this is a review for a product but I also have some advice - kids are resiliant and if your child has this don't panic like I did.  I suffered in all areas of my life for close to a year stressed out to the hilt about this - it will go away and your child will be fine but it can take awhile.  I do recommend this product if your child has a stubborn case as I do think it kept it from getting worse than it already was.,Lisa,,16,1,3,1,16-03-2015 06:54

Only people who suffer with this HS knows what I am talking about.  This is my first Jar and I plan on getting the soap and the anibotics pills to take as well to heal me of this horrible disease.  God is good and I am so grateful and thankful that I am getting my life back.  I have not been able to be loving and affectionate to my husband for many years because of this horrible skin condition.  I am looking forward to being the loving sweet person that I know I can be without the skin condition that I have suffered with for many years.  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH EMUAIDMAX and my special Friend Ms. X.  God bless you all,Muryl,,16,1,5,1,11-12-2015 13:21

,"Hi I am 54 years old last year around May I was on a cruise and experienced severe bleeding and pain after a bowl movement. I went to see a doctor after my cruise and was diagnosed with anal fissure and was told that it was at severe stage. My doctor recommended surgery. I began searching the internet and ran across this product Emuaid. The testimonies was remarkable and also too good to be true. So I decided to order and try it. I started using Emuaid in May 2015 and recieved immediate relief of pain and itch. After about 1 month my pain was gone but still little blood after each bowel movement. By February 2016 I have no pain or bleeding after bowel movement. I feel completely healed. In about 6-9 months my symptoms of pain, burning and itch was completely gone! I love this stuff, and keep it in my medicine cabinet for conditions that may arise in the future. Thank you so much!!!!",Happy Camper,35363,16,1,5,1,04-03-2016 09:16

My lips started swelling with blisters. First I had one blister on the right side of my face, then other blisters started appearing..after taking only 2 pills, it got worse so I went back to urgent care and they told me to stop taking the drugs they prescribed and the other drugs similar to it i may be allergic to it too. So i check the web for shingles treatment and I found Emuaid. I just sent for it and I hope I get it soon. If it improves my condition, I will surely write a raving review.

,"WOW! WOW! WOW! Two weeks ago, I got a case of shingles without the rash. The doctor prescribed me valacyclovir. After a week the blisters started to form. At this point, I was in extreme discomfort and start to research remedies online. That's when I stumbled on Emuaid. With all the positive feedback on their site, I figured it was paid reviews and/or fake. Then I went to Amazon and other sites, and most of the people just raved about this product. I purchased it with the mindset that it's probable snake oil. So needless to say, I didn't have huge expectations going in. I ordered the extra strength, because... go big or go home... ;). I bought on the Walgreens site because they had free 3 day shipping and was a few pennies less. The first time I applied it, I noticed the burn sensation of my skin decrease about 30%. I applied it to my back of the blistered area of 3x 6. The blisters stopped dead in their tracks and 3 days later  they were gone! Yes  it's safe to say I am a huge advocate of Emuaid now! I started to read about all of the other uses and saw it was good for anal fissures. Again  after only 3 days of application and the bleeding has stopped and the openings have all closed.

,"All I can say is THANK YOU, Emuaid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
I have been dealing with this issue I have/had for over 3 years.  I went to several doctors to find out what was wrong but no one could pinpoint my issue.  It's a bit embarrassing but I will explain as there may be someone out there that may be going through a similar issue.  It started with anal bleeding in which I was told was hemorrhoids, so okay it's life, then the area started to get blisters and itched as well as leakage.  Was then tested for herpes and that was negative but was told I had streptococcus which probably came from the scratching which I couldn't help (I know embarrassing!!!) so that was not likely the true problem.  Now I'm about a year and 1/2 into it and just got tired of going to the doctor and just thought I will tolerate this because I was fed up with all the unanswered questions.  To make a very long an painful story short, after 3 possible herpes scares and colon cancer and thousands of dollars later, I finally found Emuaid.  I had tried other ointments out there and a few holistic ones as well but it wasn't until I started using Emuaid that I started to get fewer and fewer episodes of itching, bleeding and leakage.  At first, I really didn't think it was working and I wasn't using it as suggested just at night but I was finding that my problem was almost non exsistant after about a month of use.  I coulld only conclude that the Emuaid was the reason.  As my problem had never really gone away in the last 3 years is was persistant and nothing I did helped.  So to the makers of Emuaid I thank you again!   And for those of you who don't know if this will work just try it, it might be your answer as it was mine!",Rozanna,1000,14,1,5,1,23-09-2013 14:00
,"Re:  Lichen Simplex Chronicus (LSC)

I had the classic LSC dark brown, sore, itchy splotches erupt all over my skin.  It is embarrassing and very painful.  I woke up with bloody nails from scratching each morning.  The only solution my doctor provided was steroid cream that left my skin sensitive and flaking dry - and it never fixed the problem.

To make matters even worse I developed LSC all over my vaginal area - which made sex impossible.  The region was extremely sore on a daily basis.  It was too painful to even try.  Again, my doctor gave me a different steroid cream.  It made my skin so thin - any contact in the area was like getting a series of paper cuts.  

By chance, I came across the Emuaid web site and decided that I had nothing to lose.  Within 48 hrs the condition in my vaginal area was 80% better.  By the end of the week - 100%.

It is pricey, but I will continue to pay unless it stops working. I feel good about this emuaid. I have tried every thing online and every thing that doctors had been giving me.

,"Re:  Eczema
I am not one to usually write reviews but this product worked so well, I need to let others know what it can do.  My son started to develop eczema when he was two months old.  It was on his entire body ÔÇô arms, legs, head, and under the neck/torso area.  I went to the doctor 4 times because it was so bad he couldnÔÇÖt sleep and could hardly do anything but scratch himself.  He was in mitts almost half of the day and always while sleeping otherwise I would find him with blood on his fingers and scratches all behind his ears and head.  I tired everything ÔÇô Aveno Eczema care, LaRoche Posay ÔÇô Lipakar cream, Avene XeraCalm A.D and even cortisone.  Some of these products really helped with the eczema on his body but nothing would take care of the eczema around his neck/torso area ÔÇô not even the cortisone.  I then went to a naturopathic doctor to see if there were some alternative solutions.  $200 later, I found out what foods he was sensitive to (so I could avoid him as he is breastfed) and started him on a regime of treatments including, vitamin D, flaxseed oil, vitamin E, fish oil acidophilus and a naturopathic drop made especially for eczema.  None it helped.  Staying off dairy does help reduce the number of flare-ups but the eczema without the flare-ups was still unbearable for my little guy.  Finally, I decided to research some other products on-line and Emuaid came up.  I read a ton of the reviews and finally decided why not give it a try if itÔÇÖs satisfaction or your money back.  I ordered it from their Canadian distributor (but it still cost me $23 in shipping) and received it within two business days.  After using it for 7 days straight 4 x a day, I noticed a remarkable difference.   I stopped using it for a week (only because it says on the label not to use it for more than a week) and then started a second round.  His eczema has almost totally cleared. I wish I could post before and after pictures.  I still need to stay off some of the foods that heÔÇÖs sensitive to and realize his eczema may never fully go away but this is such an improvement.  He hardly scratches himself any more and I no longer need to use mitts.  I still use the Avene XeraCalm for the rest of his body in order to keep the eczema under control.  I am actually considering cancelling my Dermatologist appointment because I will have nothing to show him/her when we go.  I am going to keep our allergist appointment.",Anonymous Customer,,14,1,5,1,25-06-2014 09:32

,"My 22 month old daughter caught mulloscum contagiosum, I thankfully got it diagnosed when she only had a few bumps. The doctor said to leave it, could take 2 months to 2 years to go away, but not to let her itch because that's how it spreads. Well.... 2 weeks later her bumps multiplied and her little cluster was almost her whole thigh covered in a big cluster of tiny bumps. I put calamine lotion to keep her from itching. Then my mother in law did some research and found emuaid. .. we started with one tub and we noticed in about a week they had definitely gotten smoother. ... I thought they were all about clear and safe( probably not contagious) so I gave her a bath for the first time since her first little bump. I was only showering her because I wasn't sure if it could spread throughout the water. Well... it did spread through the water the next morning she woke up a huge cluster on her belly, right at the water line of the bath I had given the night before. I don't know if that was a coincidence or not but I instantly started the emuaid on her belly too.... then she got a few tiny ones her face and I was super careful to keep the cream on the ones her face at all times which was easier because it wasn't cover by clothes. The ones on her face were gone by 3 days. Eventually it took 3 whole jars to complete clear the mulloscum from her leg, back and face but it's been about a month and no signs of any more bumps. I seriously recommend this product. It was a miracle cream and worth every penny. Even with 3 jars. I even used it on a little rash she got on her shoulder... i love that is safe even for babies! !!

,"My 19 year old son was suffering with moderate acne that was cyclical in nature- having bouts of breakouts that would come for a while and then eventually leave while using the current holistic, vegan acne skincare line he was using. Since results werent as we had hoped, I lnew it was time to begin looking for something else. But, before resorting to trying the antibiotics my husband had used as a teen for his severe cystic acne(which can cause serious hormonal and other side lasting effects), or other prescriptions the Dermatologist wanted him to try, I began looking for more natural options. After finding Emuaid it spunded too good to be true, but i bought a bottle for my 19 yr old son to try. After his first night's use of Emuaid on his 'angry' red and swollen blemishes, he and I were both thoroughly surprised at the results in the morning!!, The redness and swelling were at least 50% decreased after only 1 night's application!!! Within a few more nights' use, the acne had almost completely disappeared. With other natural products that include always include salicylic acid, my son always complained of the irritating and drying/flaking side effects, eventually causing him to stop using the products. With Emuaid, my son has experienced no negative side effects....in fact, he's been persistently asking me to order him another bottle so that he has a back up when his current bottle runs out....and he LOVES it!  In addition to purchasing another bottle of the overnight treatment, I will be purchasing the face/body bar and tubs of cream for my son, my mom, my friend who suffers w/Rosacia, and for myself.

,I have had a horrible battle with cystic acne period all of a sudden when I turn 40 I started getting these huge painful cyst all over my chin. Been on antibiotics and try to every over the counter acne medication I could find. Nothing worked and I would try to pop them and make a big scar and have scabs all over my face. I found this treatment and oh my goodness I cannot believe the results. As soon as I feel a cyst start to come up I apply it overnight and by the next morning it is drastically reduced in size. After day 2 and 3 the cysts are completely gone without ever making a big sore on my face. This stuff is truly a miracle,angie,,13,1,5,1,04-07-2016 01:01
,"My 14 year old daughter has battled persistent acne since she turned 11. Lymecycline antibiotics did help, eventually, after months of taking them but then she decided she didn't want to take them anymore and the acne came back, worse than before. She agreed to go back on the antibiotics but the response this time has been much slower, so I searched for an alternative. Emu aid overnight acne treatment is it- it truly is the miracle cure. In April I had a girl who's skin was in crisis- in August I have a girl with almost completely clear skin and so much more confident and happier. It took a week before we began to really believe it would work but work it has and I recommend it to anyone. Coming to the end of first bottle now after around 7 weeks of treatment and will shortly order another. It's worth every penny. Only wish it didn't cost so much to ship from the USA to the UK. It's best to buy the original product from the source.",Sarah Dyson,,13,0,5,1,13-08-2016 05:03

,"This product healed my toddler's staph infection.  She has eczema and became infected through a cut on her wrist.  We went to a pediatric dermatologist at Mt. Sinai in NYC (supposedly the best) and she prescribed a topical antibiotic.  After day 4 of the 10 day antibiotic, the staph infection got worse and started spreading.  I was hesitant to use Emuaid, which I had received prior to getting the antibiotics, after reading that silver can cause cartilage issues.  However, when the antibiotic failed to heal her, I used emuaidmaxx and saw results after the  first day.  I used it for 7 days, probably 5 times a day, and her staph infection cleared up.  She still has eczema, but at least the infection is gone.  I'm still trying to figure out how to calm down her skin.  Her eczema flares up and she's in this vicious scratching cycle.  Any recommendations?  I used the emuaid soap, but it seemed to dry her skin out.",toddler with eczema and staph infection,11451,2,1,4,1,17-07-2014 22:05

I am using emuaidmax and the 1st time I used it it took away heat n swelling from my legs and fingers. Because most of my skin is damaged,I'm almost out of the initial purchase.

,"I need to tell you that I would like to add my accolades to your reviews. I
received my Emuaid cream and soap this past weekend and couldn't wait to get
home to apply it. I have been in such pain and major discomfort for many
months. Nothing seemed to work. From the first moment after application of
the cream I felt a difference. It has now been only four days and I am pain
and itch free!  It is a miracle. How can I ever thank you, my life has been
changed",Jo,,2,1,5,1,01-05-2015 14:49
