## Terms of Use

## To Install

### Step 1: Upload files

Upload all files from `upload` into the base folder of your Magento 2 installation. Files within the `app` folder should be added to the ones you already have.

### Step 2: Run Installation

In SSH, from your site root, run the command: `php bin/magento setup:upgrade`

That will flush the cache, and trigger the installation process to run.

### Step 3: Configure the Payment Module

**Before proceeding: Sign up for an [Authorize.Net merchant account](https://ems.authorize.net/oap/home.aspx?SalesRepID=98&ResellerID=24716) if you have not done so, and ensure your account has Customer Information Manager (CIM) enabled.**

Open your Admin Panel and go to **Stores > Settings > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods**. If the extension was uploaded correctly, you will see a new setting section near the bottom titled **Authorize.Net CIM**. Enter your **API Login ID** and **Transaction Key** as found in your Authorize.Net account, and complete the rest of the settings. Once you're done, click **Save Config** to save the changes.

After saving, if the API connection is working properly, the 'API Test Results' setting will display "Authorize.Net CIM connected successfully." in green.

### Step 4: Profit

That's it! Test it out, and let us know if you have any problems.
